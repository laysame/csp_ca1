                        With Iranian society stricter than before, Marji, while waiting for Reza in the plaza one day,
                        lies to a police officer that a man made advances on her to avoid being arrested for wearing
                        makeup. Her grandmother is disappointed by Marji's behavior and berates her, telling her that
                        both her grandfather and her uncle died supporting freedom and that she should never forsake
                        them or her family by sacrificing her integrity. Realizing her mistake, Marji delivers a speech
                        during a class at the university, and her grandmother is pleased to hear that she openly
                        confronted the blatantly sexist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_standard"

                        but both Marji's and Reza's families are forced to pay a fine when they are caught holding hands
                        out in public. To avoid even more scrutiny from the religious police, the two get married, yet
                        Marji's mother worries that her daughter has made a terrible mistake in being married at such a
                        young age. A year later, Marji's relationship with Reza falls apart and Marji, after having a
                        talk with her grandmother, decides to get a divorce.

                        The fundamentalist police discover and raid a party Marji is attending, and while the women are
                        detained, the men escape across the rooftops. One of them, Nima, hesitates before jumping,
                        consequently falling to his death. After Nima's death and her divorce, Marji leaves Iran
                        permanently to avoid being targeted by the Iranian authorities as a <a

                        Before
                        leaving, she takes a trip to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caspian_Sea"

                        visits the graves of her
                        grandfather and uncle. Marji's mother forbids her from returning, and Marji agrees. Her
                        grandmother dies soon after her departure.

                        Returning to the present, Marji collects her luggage and gets into a taxi. As the taxi drives
                        away from the airport, the driver asks her where she is from and she replies "Iran", keeping the
                        promise she made to Anoosh and her grandmother that she would remember where she came from and
                        always stay true to herself. She recalls her final memory of her grandmother telling her how she
                        placed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jasmine" target="_blank">jasmine</a> in her
