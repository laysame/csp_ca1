            <p class="section1-paragraph">
                During the 1979 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Revolution" target="_blank">Iranian
                revolution</a> against the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammad_Reza_Pahlavi"

                participates in the rallies, but she is forbidden from attending. One day, Marji's uncle Anoosh
                arrives to have dinner with the family after being released from a nine-year prison sentence,
                inspiring Marji with his stories of his life on the run from the government.
            </p>
            <p class="section1-paragraph">
                The Shah is eventually deposed and elections for a new leading power commence; Marji's family's
                situation does not improve, and they are upset when <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamic_fundamentalism" target="_blank">Islamic
                fundamentalists</a> win the elections
                and start imposing strict Islamic law. The government forces women to dress modestly and wear
                headscarves, and Anoosh is rearrested and executed for his political beliefs, along with other
                political dissenters. Over time, many Iranians escape to various countries abroad.
            </p>
            <p class="section1-paragraph">
                Though disillusioned, Marji and her family try to adapt to life under the new regime. The
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Iraq_War" target="_blank">Iran–Iraq War</a>
                breaks out soon after, and Marji witnesses firsthand its horrors; meanwhile, the
                Iranian government begins implementing laws that cut down even more on social freedoms. Later,
                her uncle Taher suffers a heart attack and must go to England for surgery, but the borders are
                closed, and only people approved by the Board of Health can leave. When Marji's aunt attempts to
                get permission, she finds that the hospital director she must deal with is her former
                window-washer, who is incompetent and totally submissive to his religion.
            </p>
            <p class="section1-paragraph">
                Marji and her father go to see Khosro, a man who prints fake passports and promises to make the
                passport in a week. Khosro is sheltering Niloufar, a young woman wanted for her <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism" target="_blank">Communist</a>
                beliefs, to whom Marji takes an instant liking. Later, Niloufar is spotted and promptly arrested
                and executed; Khosro's house is ransacked in the process, and he flees without making the
                passport. Marji watches as her uncle dies, and the family tries to find solace in secret parties
                where they enjoy pleasures the government has outlawed, including <a

            </p>
            <p class="section1-paragraph">
                As she grows up, Marji refuses to stay out of trouble, secretly buying <a

                her to be arrested. She
                is expelled from school when she openly rebuts a teacher's lies about government abuses.
            </p>
            <p class="section1-paragraph">
                Fearing her arrest, Marji's parents send her to a <a

                is upset by their discriminatory and judgmental behavior. Marji
                makes few friends and ultimately feels isolated with people who view her with open disdain.
                After a while, she is thrown out of her shelter for insulting a nun, and moves between houses
                until she rents a room from Dr. Frau Schloss, an unstable former teacher.
            </p>
            <p class="section1-paragraph">
                One night, Marji hears her grandmother's voice telling her to stay true to herself as she leaves
                a party after lying to an acquaintance that she is French; her would-be lover reveals his
                homosexuality after a failed attempt at sex with her. She goes on to engage in a passionate love
                affair with a man named Markus, which ends badly when she discovers him cheating on her. Schloss
                then accuses Marji of stealing her brooch, and Marji finally leaves. She spends the day on a
                park bench, reflecting upon how "stupid" she has been, and realizes she has nowhere else left to
                go. After living on the street for a few months, she contracts <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronchitis" target="_blank">bronchitis</a> and almost
                dies.
            </p>
            <p class="section1-paragraph">
                Marji awakens in a Viennese hospital and returns to Iran with her family's permission, hoping
                that the end of the war will improve their quality of life. After spending several days watching
                television, she falls into <a class="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_depressive_disorder"

                what is
                important and encouraging her to live. Her determination is renewed, she attends university
                classes and starts a relationship with fellow student Reza.
            </p>
            <p class="section1-paragraph">
                With Iranian society stricter than before, Marji, while waiting for Reza in the plaza one day,
                lies to a police officer that a man made advances on her to avoid being arrested for wearing
                makeup. Her grandmother is disappointed by Marji's behavior and berates her, telling her that
                both her grandfather and her uncle died supporting freedom and that she should never forsake
                them or her family by sacrificing her integrity. Realizing her mistake, Marji delivers a speech
                during a class at the university, and her grandmother is pleased to hear that she openly
                confronted the blatantly sexist <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_standard"
                                                   target="_blank">double standard</a> in her university's forum

                but both Marji's and Reza's families are forced to pay a fine when they are caught holding hands
                out in public. To avoid even more scrutiny from the religious police, the two get married, yet
                Marji's mother worries that her daughter has made a terrible mistake in being married at such a
                young age. A year later, Marji's relationship with Reza falls apart and Marji, after having a
                talk with her grandmother, decides to get a divorce.
            </p>
            <p class="section1-paragraph">
                The fundamentalist police discover and raid a party Marji is attending, and while the women are
                detained, the men escape across the rooftops. One of them, Nima, hesitates before jumping,
                consequently falling to his death. After Nima's death and her divorce, Marji leaves Iran
                permanently to avoid being targeted by the Iranian authorities as a <a

                Returning to the present, Marji collects her luggage and gets into a taxi. As the taxi drives
                away from the airport, the driver asks her where she is from and she replies "Iran", keeping the
                promise she made to Anoosh and her grandmother that she would remember where she came from and
                always stay true to herself. She recalls her final memory of her grandmother telling her how she

            <p class="section4-paragraph mb-1">
                Directed by Christian Desmares, the film was produced by a total of twenty animators. Initially
                opposed to producing an animated movie due to the high level of difficulty, producers
                Marc-Antoine Robert and Xavier Regault gave protagonist, Marjane Satrapi, alternative options of
                film production to avoid animation. As admitted by producer Robert, "I know the new generation
                of French comic book artists quite well, and I'm afraid of Marjane's. I offered to write an
                original script for her, because I didn't want to work on an animated movie at all...I knew how
                complicated it was".<sup>[6]</sup> And yet, despite the difficulty, the producers followed
                through with
                Satrapi's wishes and focused on interpreting her life story as depicted in her novel Persepolis,
                ""With live-action, it would have turned into a story of people living in a distant land who
                don't look like us," Satrapi says. "At best, it would have been an exotic story, and at worst, a
                'third-world' story".<sup>[6]</sup>
            </p>
            <p class="section4-paragraph mb-1">
                The animation team worked alongside Satrapi to gain a detailed understanding of the types of
                graphic images she deemed necessary for accuracy. Following her guidelines, the animators, such
                as interviewee Marc Jousset, commented on their use of the "tradition animation techniques"
                Satrapi requested to keep the drawings simple and avoid the "more high-tech techniques" that
                "would look dated".<sup>[7]</sup> Satrapi's vision, according to Jousset, involved a lot of
                focus on the
                characters' natural, humane physical imperfections.
            </p>
            <p class="section4-paragraph mb-1">
                During their initial stages of production, the animation team attempted to use 2D image
                techniques "on pen tablets," but were immediately unsatisfied with the product due to the lack
                of definition, Jousset has said.<sup>[7]</sup> Applying traditional techniques as simple as
                paper and ink
                to the production allowed Satrapi to use methods she was familiar with. As a result, Satrapi
                crafted an image depiction she, herself, would recognize as her own work, and thus, her own
                story. "It was clear that a traditional animation technique was perfectly suited to Marjane's
                and Vincent's idea of the film".<sup>[7]</sup>
            </p>
            <p class="section4-paragraph mb-1">
                Choosing black and white as the film's dominant colors was an intentional choice by Satrapi,
                along with the director and animation team, to continue on the path of traditional animation
                techniques. Despite its simplicity, members of the animation team such as Jousset discussed how
                black and white makes imperfections more obvious: "Using only black and white in an animation
                movie requires a great deal of discipline. From a technical point of view, you can't make any
                mistakes...it shows up straight away on the large screen".<sup>[7]</sup> In addition to color
                display, the
                animation team worked especially hard on techniques that mimicked the styles of Japanese
                cartoonists, known as "manga," and translating them into their own craft of "a specific style,
                both realistic and mature. No bluffing, no tricks, nothing overcooked".<sup>[7]</sup> According
                to Jousset,
                "Marjane had quite an unusual way of working...Marjane insisted on being filmed playing out all
                the scenes...it was a great source of information for the animators, giving them an accurate
                approach to how they should work".<sup>[7]</sup> With this in mind, the animators commented on
                the immense
                hardships they faced when creating each image of "1,200 shots" through Satrapi's perspective
                because even though "Marjane's drawings looked very simple and graphic...they're very difficult
                to work on because there are so few identifying marks. Realistic drawings require outstanding
                accuracy".<sup>[7]</sup> Despite the difficulties in working with animation film, however,
                Satrapi's drive
                and determination to make the film motivated the animators to finish each graphic image with
                full accuracy. Following alongside a more traditional style of graphic imagery was not only
                difficult in terms of drawing, but also in terms of locating a team to draw the images since
                traditional animators "hardly exist in France anymore".<sup>[7]</sup> With a group of more than
                100 people,
                though, animator Pascal Chevé confirmed the variety of style each team member brought to the
                table: "An animator will be more focused on trying to make the character move in the right way.
                Assistant animators will then put the final touches to the drawings to make sure they're true to
                the original. Then the 'trace' team comes in, and they work on each drawing with...a felt pen,
                to ensure that they are consistent with the line that runs throughout the movie".<sup>[7]</sup>
            </p>
            <p class="section4-paragraph mb-1">
                Although it was hard to craft realistic cartoon drawings, Jousset said the biggest challenge was
                staying on schedule and within budget of "6 million Euros, which is reasonable for a 2D movie
                made in France",<sup>[7]</sup> but that "I think the culmination of the fact that it was a true
                story, that
                the main character worked with you, that an animated movie dealt with a current issue and that
                it was intended for adults was tremendously exciting for the team".<sup>[7]</sup>
